OneXPlayer Script/configs
Written for a Mini AMD 5800U

Intent is to create a series of scripts to stop running services, and either uninstall, or remove bloatware from the devices. 

In stopping the services from running I attempt to only stop processes that will not interfere with any form of the gameplay. 
As these are networking devices I leave all wireless, wired, DHCP, DNS attributions alone and only focus on the non-essential services, for gameplay. 


Please read the script and make sure it is something you want to run. 


deleteapps.ps1 Powershell script to remove windows bloat without breaking windows for gaming. 

stopsrvcs.ps1 stops the running services to give you more resources before you play. 

Let me know where I can improve.
